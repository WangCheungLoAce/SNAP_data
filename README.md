### Summary of Data

SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) provides food assistance benefits to low-income families in the United States. This program helps families purchase nutritious food items, promoting health and overall well-being. SNAP benefits are distributed through electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards, which work like debit cards at participating grocery stores and retailers. The aim of SNAP is to alleviate hunger and improve access to essential food items for vulnerable populations.

The SNAP Retailer Locator Power BI is an tool that enables users to find nearby retailers authorized to accept SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. By entering zip code, users can pinpoint SNAP-eligible retailers and access detailed information and directions to the address and store type. Although primarily designed for SNAP recipients, the tool is also useful for government agencies, community organizations, and others assisting SNAP beneficiaries. The data from the SNAP Retailer Locator, which includes retailer details and geographic coordinates, can be downloaded as a CSV file for easy integration into desktop spreadsheet applications.
